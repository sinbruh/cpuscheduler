# Report Group 2

This report is a document documenting what each group member have learned throughout working on this project.

## Sindre
The project has been a positive experience for me, as I've gotten more experience
with working together with other people on programming. During the project, we have used
techniques such as pair programming to collaborate together and solve problems. I've also
gotten some more experience on managing time and effectively communicating with my group
members.

## Daniel
Even tough I was not the one coming up with the code, I learned quite a lot about the 
FCFS algorithm and the preemptive priorityscheduling algorithm. I learned how different 
processes were handled in the two different algorithms. Also working in bigger groups made 
it easier to get unstuck when a problem was met.

## Sander
I have learned a lot about the two different algorithms. I did not partake the most
in the programming aspect of this assignment, but I tried my best to help the others
with what I could. So my takeaway after this assignment is a deeper understanding of the two
algorithms and how to think regarding the programming.
