# Report Group 2

This report is a document documenting what each group member have learned throughout working on this project.

## Sindre
The project has been a positive experience for me, as I've gotten more experience
with working together with other people on programming. During the project, we have used
techniques such as pair programming to collaborate together and solve problems. I've also
gotten some more experience on managing time and effectively communicating with my group
members.
