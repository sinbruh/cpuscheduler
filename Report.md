# Report Group 2

This report is a document documenting what each group member have learned throughout working on this project.

Even tough I was not the one coming up with the code, I learned quite a lot about the 
FCFS algorithm and the preemptive priorityscheduling algorithm. I learned how different 
processes were handled in the two different algorithms. Also working in bigger groups made 
it easier to get unstuck when a problem was met.

## Sander
I have learned a lot about the two different algorithms. I did not partake the most
in the programming aspect of this assignment, but I tried my best to help the others
with what I could. So my takeaway after this assignment is a deeper understanding of the two
algorithms and how to think regarding the programming.
